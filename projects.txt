# Project list. The purpose of this list is to define the project names that are expected in
# the input workbook. It is also used to specify the order in which they should appear in the
# output spreadsheet to match the order in the web time cards. It doesnâ€™t hurt if there are
# more projects than there are actually active in the time card.
